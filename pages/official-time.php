  <h1>Official Time</h1>
  <p>Our platform uses synchronized server time to ensure fairness for auctions, offers, and time-limited deals.</p>

  <h2>Why official time matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistent auction end times across regions</li>
    <li>Accurate order timestamps and dispute resolution</li>
    <li>Reliable logs for performance analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Time zones</h2>
  <p>Display times may be localized to your browser settings, but all core events are recorded against our official server time.</p>
